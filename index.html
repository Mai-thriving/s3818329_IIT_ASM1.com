<div class="sans-serif">
  <ul>
    <p>My interest in IT ignited first when I realized that nowadays, many giant corporations were technology-based and that digital startups accounted for most of the successful and young companies in this decade. Moreover, this industry does not require as intensive capital investment as others, such as manufacturing or transportation, and there is still a lot of space in this sector for those ambitious youngsters like me to thrive.</p>
    <p>Until recently, after joining a session about Digital Business hosted by RMIT Career Mentoring, I was inspired by the words of Mr. John Masud Parvez that actually, the growth of technology had helped us with easy tasks and left us with more difficult jobs that required human intervention. Being impressed by this sharing, I have seen the magnitude of acquiring IT knowledge and applying it to my future career, which then leads me to the decision of choosing the course of Introduction to IT of RMIT Vietnam to ameliorate my IT proficiency. Furthermore, digital innovation has raised thought-provoking questions in me about how it can alter the way people interact with each other (and even with the machines) and how the society will develop in the future. Will there be any chance that robots can live and work harmoniously with humans? Should we, the human beings, be dramatically worried about the massive improvement of technology?</p>
    <p>RMIT becomes the destination of my choice due to its up-to-date infrastructure, and also because most of the alumni of RMIT have been seen to earn successful achievement after graduating, which has left a profound impression of the quality of this school on me.</p>
    <p>During my learning journey at RMIT, I hope to be encountered with realistic and practical experiences which can be gained from the learning materials, from the assistance of the lecturers and my mates, as well as the participation in extracurricular activities operated by the school clubs.</p>

</div>

<p>
  <ul>
  <br>The results of these tests show that my personality is a mix of sensitivity, creativity, perfectionism, and self-reliance.
  <br>As I am a perfection-seeker, I tend to expect my teammates to be as aggressive, as passionate, and as hard-working as me when working on a project, which can sometimes lead to the unnecessary overwhelmingness of my co-workers. Therefore, I may end up making all of my them stressed out or making myself a lone wolf (which is not truly desirable in the IT industry).
  <br>Also, due to my appreciation of originality, creativity and open-mindedness are other aspects which I hope my teammates can acquire. Despite my sensitivity, it is still favorable for me to work with those who have critical thinking and are able to see what I cannot see to challenge my ideas, so that the novel ideas which are more unique and realistic can be carried out.
  <br>In brief, to alleviate the risk that I will complete the project all by myself, the most ideal type of teammates for me will be the ones who are ambitious, innovative, and are able to reasonably reflect on the ideas of others to bring out the useful evaluation which can enhance the utility of our project.

  <h1><p class="impact"> 5. PROJECT IDEAS </p></h1>
</div>

<div class="a">
  <h2><b><p class="sans-serif"> a. Overview </p></b></h2>
</div>

<p class="sans-serif">
  <p class="b">
  <ul>This project is about a mobile app that can help people whenever they arrive at the airport in a foreign country to find the right gate for their transits, look for the baggage area, the restrooms…, as well as keeping track of the information about their flights. By providing them with 3D graphic illustration along with voice instructions (based on the native language of the user), this app acts as a friendly guide who can mitigate the feeling of unfamiliarity and the risk of being lost for passengers when they first travel to places they have never known before.
  </ul>
  </p>
</p>

<div class="a">
  <h2><b><p class="sans-serif"> b. Motivation </p></b></h2>
</div>

<p class="sans-serif">
  <p class="b">
  <ul> I came up with this idea once I talked to a cousin of mine who was studying abroad in a European country. As there was no direct flight between Vietnam and that country, he had to have a transit flight in a third country. When arriving at the transit airport, despite having excellent English skills, it still took him a lot of time to find the right gate for his next flight, and as a result, he was late and must pay for another flight. After this experience, he always had to choose a transit flight whose waiting time should be above 2 hours, enough for him to find the right gate without being late. His negative experience has prompted in me a question: wouldn’t it be better if we always have 3D graphic guidelines in front of our face which can help us imagine exactly where we should go and which direction we should follow, amid an enormous airport where the signboards can be very confusing?
  </ul>
  </p>
</p>

<div class="a">
  <h2><b><p class="sans-serif"> c. Description </p></b></h2>
</div>

<p class="sans-serif">
  <p class="b">
  <ul>
    <br>When passengers arrive at the airport, they can open the app, type in the flight number and specify their needs, whether they want to find the transit gate, the baggage area, or the exit way. The app will provide the specific guidelines for users on how to get there via augmented reality. The illustration demonstrated on their phone will resemble exactly what they see in front of them. In addition, the information about the nearest free socket for users to charge their electronic devices will appear when they click on the “Nearest socket” section in the Navigation Bar.
    <br>Also, the app will show the time the users need to get to the desired place, and will present the suitable offers for them to enjoy the services at the airport after getting to that place, without the worry of being lost. The passengers can customize these offers themselves by choosing which type of services they would like to experience, for instance Asian restaurants, local dishes, souvenirs… The users can specify how much time they will spend at that spot for the app to calculate the level of comfort when the users go there: based on the position of the area of services where the users want to go to and the time they have left before their leaving, the app will pop up a small notification (if the spot locates so far) to remind them about the limited time they have and that it is more favorable to select another option. This data will be stored to provide recommendations for the users in later usage.
    <br>Moreover, real-time data about the flight such as the boarding gate, the time delayed, the baggage gate, the weather,… are available on the app as well. In case there are changes, passengers can be kept from missing such important information without having to always listen to the speaker carefully at a boisterous airport. On top of that, should there be a delay for more than 4 hours (this number of hours can be different depending on the policies of different countries and different airlines brands (Vietnam Airlines 2020, Bamboo Airways n.d.), in the case of Vietnam, it is 4 hours or above of a delay for a passenger to ask for compensation, according to Circular 14/2015/TT-BGTVT of the government), the users can find possible steps to ask for indemnification when specifying their airline and the country where they are currently in, then accordingly the app will direct them to the website of the compensation regulations of each brand. Provided that the airport has the sleeping spot for the passengers to rest during the delayed time, it will be also presented to the users.
    <br>A notification will be sent to the users withal when it is 15 minutes and 5 minutes before their departure time.
    <br>Besides, for those elders who find typing on a smartphone too difficult, voice assistant (to implement the command from humans without typing) is at their disposal and can be turned on to assist them in avoiding this nuisance.
